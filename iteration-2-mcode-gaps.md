# Breast Cancer Prior Authorization Data Requirements: mCODE Mapping and Gaps

## Purpose

This working matrix identifies breast cancer prior authorization (PA) data requirements and maps them to likely mCODE / FHIR representations. The intent is to distinguish:

- Data elements already well supported by mCODE.
- Data elements supported by mCODE but requiring PA-specific constraints.
- Data elements that likely require new profiles, extensions, or DTR capture patterns.

This matrix is intended to support the oncology CRD/CDS Hooks extension pattern in which:

```text
PlanDefinition = ordered anti-cancer regimen
Library.dataRequirement = required patient context
DataRequirement = individual computable requirement
Questionnaire = DTR collection instrument
Bundle / FHIR API = actual patient data
```

## Important note on staging

Staging should not be treated as simply “missing” from mCODE.

mCODE supports AJCC/TNM-based staging through cancer stage and TNM-specific profiles. In particular, mCODE includes a TNM Stage Group profile for the overall AJCC stage group, and its TNM staging method value set is used in `Observation.method` for both the stage group and the separate T, N, and M category observations.

The gap for breast cancer PA is therefore not basic representation. The gap is PA-specific profiling:

- Whether **clinical stage** or **pathologic stage** is required.
- Whether the **AJCC stage group** is sufficient.
- Whether separate **T, N, and M categories** are required.
- Which **AJCC edition / staging method** is acceptable.
- Whether staging must represent **current disease state** versus historical diagnosis stage.
- How the staging observation is linked to the primary breast cancer condition and evidence source.

Recommended classification:

```text
mCODE coverage: Strong foundation
Gap: PA-specific cardinality, clinical vs pathologic stage, TNM component requirements, AJCC edition/method, currentness
Action: Define breast cancer PA staging requirements in the DataRequirement Library
```

## Breast Cancer PA Data Requirements Matrix

| PA / guideline decision data element | Why it matters for breast cancer PA | Likely mCODE / FHIR representation | mCODE coverage | Gap / issue | Recommended modeling action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Patient identity / demographics | Required for authorization matching and benefit processing | `Patient`, likely US Core Patient; mCODE Cancer Patient profile may apply | Strong | mCODE is not the payer identity layer | Use US Core Patient for exchange; reference mCODE Cancer Patient where oncology context is needed |
| Primary breast cancer diagnosis | Establishes the condition being treated | `Condition` conforming to `mcode-primary-cancer-condition` | Strong | Need breast-specific coding constraints and laterality expectations | Require `mcode-primary-cancer-condition`; bind diagnosis to breast cancer value set; add laterality expectation |
| Histology / morphology | Treatment and guideline pathways differ by invasive carcinoma, DCIS, special histologies, etc. | mCODE disease characterization patterns; possibly `Condition` / `Observation` depending implementation | Partial | No single breast PA-ready profile for histology + morphology + receptor subtype | Add breast cancer diagnosis detail slice or companion Observation requirements |
| Laterality | Breast cancer staging, surgery, radiation, recurrence, and site-specific therapy may depend on side | Could be body site / laterality extension on condition or related observation | Partial | Often inconsistently represented | Require laterality for breast primary cancer condition unless not applicable |
| AJCC TNM stage group | Determines broad disease setting, such as early-stage, locally advanced, metastatic | `Observation` conforming to mCODE TNM Stage Group / Cancer Stage profiles; `Observation.method` indicates AJCC edition | Strong foundation | PA profile must specify whether clinical or pathologic stage group is required, acceptable AJCC edition, and lookback/currentness | Require TNM stage group when stage group is sufficient for authorization logic; constrain method to accepted AJCC editions |
| Clinical stage group | Needed before definitive surgery, especially neoadjuvant therapy | mCODE TNM clinical stage group Observation | Strong foundation | Must distinguish from pathologic stage | Add explicit DataRequirement for clinical stage group in neoadjuvant/preoperative contexts |
| Pathologic stage group | Needed after surgery, especially adjuvant treatment | mCODE TNM pathologic stage group Observation | Strong foundation | Must distinguish from clinical stage and tie to surgery/pathology date | Add explicit DataRequirement for pathologic stage group in adjuvant/postoperative contexts |
| T category | Tumor size/extent; may affect adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment selection | mCODE TNM primary tumor category Observation | Strong foundation | Stage group alone may hide decision-relevant tumor details | Require T category where regimen/policy depends on tumor size or extent |
| N category | Nodal involvement; central to breast cancer adjuvant/neoadjuvant decisions | mCODE TNM regional nodes category Observation | Strong foundation | Stage group alone may not be sufficient for node-positive logic | Require N category where nodal status affects regimen eligibility |
| M category | Distant metastasis; distinguishes metastatic disease | mCODE TNM distant metastases category Observation | Strong foundation | PA may need current metastatic status, not just historical staging | Require M category or disease status for metastatic-regimen evaluation |
| Staging method / AJCC edition | Ensures stage is interpreted correctly | `Observation.method` using mCODE TNM staging method value set | Strong foundation | PA profile must declare accepted staging system/edition | Require `Observation.method`; specify accepted AJCC edition(s) or allow latest available |
| Stage timing / currentness | PA decisions need current disease context | `Observation.effective[x]`, links to condition | Partial | Need workflow-specific recency rules | Add data-requirement guidance for current vs historical stage |
| Link from stage to cancer condition | Ensures stage applies to the breast cancer being treated | `Observation.focus` / related references depending profile | Strong foundation | Must be required in PA profile | Require association to the primary cancer condition |

| Disease status / progression | Many metastatic PA rules require progression, recurrence, stable disease, or response | `mcode-cancer-disease-status` | Strong foundation | Need evidence date, prior treatment association, and “progressed on X” semantics | Use disease status plus prior therapy linkage; define progression-after-therapy profile/extension if needed |
| Recurrence status | Distinguishes new primary, recurrence, and progression | Disease status, condition history, observation | Partial | No single clean recurrence model for PA | Add breast cancer recurrence status requirement where regimen depends on recurrence |
| Treatment setting | Adjuvant, neoadjuvant, metastatic, recurrent, maintenance | Could be `PlanDefinition` extension, `CarePlan`, `Observation`, or regimen context | Weak | Not consistently modeled in mCODE as a computable regimen attribute | Add required `regimenIntent` / `treatmentSetting` extension on regimen `PlanDefinition` |
| Line of therapy | Central for metastatic treatment sequencing and PA | Usually not first-class in mCODE; may be Observation or extension | Weak / missing | mCODE treatment events do not compute or declare line of therapy directly | Define `OncologyLineOfTherapy` profile or regimen extension; require for metastatic/recurrent settings |
| Ordered anti-cancer regimen (instance) | PA should evaluate the coordinated regimen, not isolated drugs | `RequestGroup` (`instantiatesCanonical` \u2192 `PlanDefinition` regimen definition) | Missing in mCODE | mCODE has treatment resources but no first-class ordered regimen profile | Create `OncologyAntiCancerRegimenRequestGroup` as the CDS Hooks payload; `RequestGroup.instantiatesCanonical` references `OncologyAntiCancerRegimenPlanDefinition` |\n| Regimen definition | Canonical, reusable protocol backing the ordered instance | `PlanDefinition` with `type = order-set` | Missing in mCODE | No first-class mCODE regimen/order-set definition profile | Create `OncologyAntiCancerRegimenPlanDefinition`; referenced from `RequestGroup.instantiatesCanonical` |
| Regimen component medications | Needed for drug-specific coverage and regimen completeness | `mcode-cancer-related-medication-request`; later `MedicationAdministration` or `MedicationStatement` | Strong for individual medication requests | Individual meds do not by themselves express coordinated regimen logic | Link component orders to regimen actions; include component `MedicationRequest`s at `order-sign` when available |
| Supportive medications | May be included in order set but not always part of anti-cancer regimen PA | MedicationRequest, potentially non-mCODE | Partial | Need to distinguish anti-cancer therapy components from supportive care | Add component role on regimen action: anti-cancer, supportive, premedication, rescue, monitoring |

| Patient preference / shared decision | May justify therapy variation | `Consent`, `QuestionnaireResponse`, note | Weak / outside mCODE | Not computable in most EHRs | Capture through DTR QuestionnaireResponse when required |
| Clinical note / unstructured evidence | Often contains line of therapy, progression, rationale | `DocumentReference` | Generic FHIR | Hard to compute; may be needed as fallback | Allow DTR attachment or DocumentReference as fallback, but prioritize discrete DataRequirements |
| Current disease burden / measurable disease | Needed for metastatic response/progression criteria | Imaging reports, Observations, disease status | Partial | mCODE does not fully model RECIST-style measurable disease for PA | Use disease status initially; define advanced imaging/response profile later |
| Pathology report | Source evidence for diagnosis, biomarkers, histology | `DiagnosticReport`, `Observation`, `DocumentReference` | Partial via observations | Full report is often unstructured | Require discrete Observations where possible; allow DocumentReference fallback |
| Imaging evidence | Supports staging/progression/metastasis | `DiagnosticReport`, `ImagingStudy`, `Observation`, `DocumentReference` | Generic FHIR / partial mCODE | Structured progression evidence is limited | Use disease status plus source references; allow imaging report DocumentReference |

## Priority gaps to address first

| Gap | Why it is high priority | Proposed artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Regimen/order-set as a first-class object | Oncology PA is regimen-centered, not only drug-order-centered | `OncologyAntiCancerRegimenPlanDefinition` profile with `type = order-set` |
| Treatment setting | Most breast cancer logic branches by adjuvant, neoadjuvant, metastatic, recurrent, maintenance | `regimenIntent` / `treatmentSetting` extension or profile element |
| Line of therapy | Required for metastatic sequencing and payer policy | `OncologyLineOfTherapy` Observation/profile or regimen extension |
| Prior therapy summary | PA needs “prior HER2 therapy,” “prior CDK4/6,” “progressed on endocrine therapy,” etc. | Prior therapy DataRequirements plus optional `OncologyPriorTherapySummary` |
| Staging constraints | mCODE supports AJCC/TNM, but PA needs clear rules for stage group vs T/N/M, clinical vs pathologic, AJCC edition, and currentness | Breast cancer PA staging slice in `Library.dataRequirement[]` |
| Biomarker normalization | ER/PR/HER2 exist as observations, but PA needs normalized values | Breast-specific value sets and result normalization rules |
| Exception documentation | Needed when a regimen is appropriate despite missing/failed preferred criteria | DTR QuestionnaireResponse plus exception/contraindication profile |
| Data requirements publication | Need cancer-specific, reusable requirements for CRD and DTR | `Library.dataRequirement[]` profile, e.g. `BreastCancerPADataRequirementsLibrary` |

## Summary

mCODE can represent many of the underlying clinical facts needed for breast cancer PA, including primary cancer condition, tumor marker tests, TNM stage group, T/N/M categories, disease status, performance status, genomics, and cancer-related treatment events.

The missing layer is not a wholesale replacement for mCODE. The missing layer is a breast cancer PA-specific `DataRequirement` package that specifies:

1. Which mCODE / US Core elements are required.
2. Which requirements are conditional by treatment setting.
3. When stage group is sufficient versus when T/N/M components are required.
4. How to distinguish clinical and pathologic staging.
5. Which biomarker results must be normalized.
6. How to represent line of therapy, treatment setting, regimen identity, and exception documentation.

This supports a reusable CRD/DTR pattern:

```text
CRD evaluates whether the required patient context is present.
DTR collects or prepopulates missing patient context.
PAS submits the authorization package when PA is still required.
```
