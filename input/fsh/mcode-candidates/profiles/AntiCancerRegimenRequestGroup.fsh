Id: anticancer-regimen-requestgroup
Title: "Anti-Cancer Regimen RequestGroup"
Description: """A patient-specific ordered anti-cancer therapy regimen instance.
This resource is included in the CDS Hooks draftOrders Bundle and referenced in
context.selections at order-select and order-sign.

RequestGroup.instantiatesCanonical SHALL be populated with the canonical URL of the
AntiCancerRegimenPlanDefinition when the canonical regimen definition is known.

Two scheduling patterns are supported in regimen actions:

1. **Cycle-day timing** — Each action (or action.action for phased regimens) uses the
   local extension `http://hl7.org/fhir/us/codex-ocpa/StructureDefinition/regimen-days-of-cycle`
   on action.timingTiming to declare which days of the cycle the drug is administered.
   The action.timingTiming.repeat carries the machine-computable cycle period.

2. **Sequential phase ordering** — For multi-phase regimens (e.g., AC→T),
   top-level action groups represent phases and action.relatedAction with
   relationship = after-end declares that the second phase begins after the first.

**mCODE Migration Candidate** — This profile is proposed for inclusion in mCODE STU5.
It is the MVP artifact for oncology prior authorization: the selected clinical unit
passed to the CRD service."""
