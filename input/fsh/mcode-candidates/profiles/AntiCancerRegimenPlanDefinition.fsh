Title: "Anti-Cancer Regimen PlanDefinition"
Description: """A canonical, reusable anti-cancer therapy regimen definition represented
as a FHIR PlanDefinition order set. This resource is NOT patient-specific; it is
referenced by AntiCancerRegimenRequestGroup instances via RequestGroup.instantiatesCanonical.

A regimen definition describes the protocol — component drugs, timing, cycle structure,
sequential phase ordering — and carries the clinical context attributes (intent, treatment
line, disease context) needed for CRD pre-approval evaluation.

**mCODE Migration Candidate** — This profile is proposed for inclusion in mCODE STU5.
It addresses the gap documented in the mCODE gap analysis: mCODE does not currently
represent anti-cancer regimens as first-class, computable entities."""
