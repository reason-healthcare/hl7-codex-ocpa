# Use Cases and Actors - MOPA — Medical Oncology Prior Authorization v0.1.0

## Use Cases and Actors

### Actors

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Oncology CRD Client** | An EHR or ordering system that invokes CDS Hooks`order-select`or`order-sign`during anti-cancer regimen ordering |
| **Oncology CRD Service** | A payer coverage decision service that evaluates the ordered regimen by querying the EHR's FHIR API for required patient context, returning cards or an Authorization Satisfied result |
| **DTR Client** | A system that collects missing patient context using questionnaires when the CRD service could not retrieve sufficient data from the EHR FHIR server |
| **PAS Client** | A system that submits a structured prior authorization request when PA is required after CRD/DTR |
| **PAS Server** | A payer system that receives and adjudicates the PA request |
| **Guideline Authority** | An organization (e.g., NCCN, ASCO, internal pathways program) that publishes canonical regimen definitions as computable`PlanDefinition`artifacts |

### The Two-Layer Framework

This IG defines two connected layers that together address the full oncology PA workflow.

#### Layer 1 — Pre-Order Clinical Decision Support (optional)

Before a clinician places an order, the EHR surfaces clinical guideline-aligned regimen recommendations based on the patient's specific situation: diagnosis, stage, biomarkers, and line of therapy.

This layer:

* Evaluates patient-specific context against computable clinical guidelines
* Returns recommended regimens with clinical guideline-aligned options
* Surfaces clinically relevant regimen choices before the order is placed

This layer is **provider-driven**, **guideline-informed**, and focuses on selecting the right treatment upfront.

The upstream standards proposals for this workflow are collected on the [Da Vinci Gap Proposals](davinci-gap-proposals.md) and [mCODE Gap Proposals](mcode-gap-proposals.md) pages.

#### Layer 2 — Structured Authorization Exchange (Da Vinci CRD → DTR → PAS)

Once a regimen is selected, the workflow uses the standard Da Vinci CRD/DTR/PAS sequence:

* **CRD** receives the ordered `RequestGroup` and — if provided FHIR authorization — queries the EHR's FHIR server directly for the oncology patient context required to evaluate the order
* **DTR** collects any missing data the CRD service could not retrieve from the EHR FHIR server
* **PAS** submits the structured authorization package when PA is still required

### Workflow: Complete Oncology PA Sequence

1. Clinician opens patient chart and begins treatment planning
1. [Optional] Pre-order CDS evaluates patient context and returns clinical guideline-aligned regimen options before order selection
1. Clinician selects anti-cancer regimen → EHR creates draft RequestGroup (RequestGroup.instantiatesCanonical → PlanDefinition regimen definition)
1. EHR fires standard CDS Hooks`order-select`:
* Selected `RequestGroup` in `context.selections` and `context.draftOrders`
* `fhirAuthorization` included when EHR FHIR access is available

1. CRD Service evaluates:
* Reads the `RequestGroup` to identify the ordered regimen
* If `fhirAuthorization` is provided, queries the EHR FHIR server for required oncology context (cancer condition, staging, biomarkers, line of therapy, etc.)
* Evaluates retrieved context against coverage policy
IF context sufficient + criteria satisfied → Authorization Satisfied (PA bypassed) IF context incomplete in EHR → return DTR launch card IF context complete but criteria not met → return PA required card
1. DTR (if launched) uses the oncology questionnaire to:
* Prepopulate known patient data from the EHR
* Collect missing documentation not found via FHIR query

1. At order-sign, EHR includes instantiated component MedicationRequest resources in the RequestGroup actions
1. PAS (if PA required) submits structured authorization package Payer adjudicates and returns decision

### Pre-Conditions

For the full workflow to operate:

* The EHR SHALL have access to relevant patient context (mCODE-based Observations, Conditions, MedicationRequests)
* A canonical regimen definition (`OncologyAntiCancerRegimenPlanDefinition`) SHOULD be available for the ordered regimen
* The EHR SHOULD provide `fhirAuthorization` in the CDS Hooks request so the CRD service can query patient context directly

### Relationship to Da Vinci

This IG extends Da Vinci CRD/DTR/PAS. It does not replace any Da Vinci workflow. Systems implementing this IG SHALL also conform to the relevant Da Vinci IGs for the workflows they support.
