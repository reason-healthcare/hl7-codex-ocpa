# Use Cases and Actors - Oncology Guideline and Coverage Authorization (OGCA) v0.1.0

## Use Cases and Actors

### Actors

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Oncology CRD Client** | An EHR or ordering system that invokes CDS Hooks`order-select`or`order-sign`during anti-cancer regimen ordering |
| **Oncology CRD Service** | A coverage decision service that evaluates the ordered regimen and required patient context, returning cards or pre-approval status |
| **DTR Client** | A system that collects missing patient context using questionnaires driven by the data requirements Library |
| **PAS Client** | A system that submits a structured prior authorization request when PA is required after CRD/DTR |
| **PAS Server** | A payer system that receives and adjudicates the PA request |
| **Guideline Authority** | An organization (e.g., NCCN, ASCO, internal pathways program) that publishes canonical regimen definitions as computable`PlanDefinition`artifacts |

### The Two-Layer Framework

This IG defines two connected layers that together address the full oncology PA workflow.

#### Layer 1 — Pre-Order Clinical Decision Support (optional)

Before a clinician places an order, the EHR surfaces guideline-aligned regimen recommendations based on the patient's specific situation: diagnosis, stage, biomarkers, and line of therapy.

This layer:

* Evaluates patient-specific context against computable clinical guidelines
* Returns recommended regimens with approvable vs. non-approvable options
* Increases the probability that the treatment ordered meets payer criteria **before** the order is placed

This layer is **provider-driven**, **guideline-informed**, and focuses on selecting the right treatment upfront.

#### Layer 2 — Structured Authorization Exchange (Da Vinci CRD → DTR → PAS)

Once a regimen is selected, the workflow uses the Da Vinci CRD/DTR/PAS sequence with oncology-specific extensions:

* **CRD** evaluates the ordered `RequestGroup` regimen instance, using the cancer-specific data requirements Library to determine whether pre-approval can be granted
* **DTR** uses the same data requirements to collect or prepopulate missing patient context
* **PAS** submits the structured authorization package when PA is still required

### Workflow: Complete Oncology PA Sequence

1. Clinician opens patient chart and begins treatment planning
1. [Optional] Pre-order CDS evaluates patient context and returns guideline-aligned regimen options before order selection
1. Clinician selects anti-cancer regimen → EHR creates draft RequestGroup (RequestGroup.instantiatesCanonical → PlanDefinition regimen definition)
1. EHR invokes CDS Hooks order-select with oncology extension:
* Selected RequestGroup in context.selections and draftOrders
* Oncology extension identifying regimen and data requirements Library

1. CRD Service evaluates:
* Is required patient context complete?
* Does the regimen meet guideline / policy criteria?
IF complete + criteria satisfied → pre-approval or no PA required IF context incomplete → return DTR launch card IF complete but criteria not met → return PA required card
1. DTR (if launched) uses data requirements Library to:
* Select or generate questionnaire
* Prepopulate known patient data
* Collect missing documentation

1. At order-sign, EHR includes instantiated component MedicationRequest resources in the RequestGroup actions
1. PAS (if PA required) submits structured authorization package Payer adjudicates and returns decision

### Pre-Conditions

For the full workflow to operate:

* The EHR SHALL have access to relevant patient context (mCODE-based Observations, Conditions, MedicationRequests)
* A canonical regimen definition (`OncologyAntiCancerRegimenPlanDefinition`) SHOULD be available for the ordered regimen
* The CRD Service SHALL have access to a cancer-specific data requirements Library (e.g., `BreastCancerPADataRequirementsLibrary`)

### Relationship to Da Vinci

This IG extends Da Vinci CRD/DTR/PAS. It does not replace any Da Vinci workflow. Systems implementing this IG SHALL also conform to the relevant Da Vinci IGs for the workflows they support.
