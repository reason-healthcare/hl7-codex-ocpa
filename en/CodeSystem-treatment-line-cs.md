# Treatment Line Code System - Oncology Guideline and Coverage Authorization (OGCA) v0.1.0

## CodeSystem: Treatment Line Code System (Experimental) 

 
Ordinal codes representing the line of systemic anti-cancer therapy. These codes are used in the TreatmentLineVS value set and on the LineOfTherapyObservation and regimen profiles. 
**mCODE Migration Candidate** — These codes are proposed for adoption in mCODE STU5 or as a SNOMED CT extension request. Once standard codes are available, this code system should be deprecated. 

**⚠ mCODE Migration Candidate**

This Treatment Line Code System is defined in this IG as a **temporary home** while a formal proposal to incorporate it into [mCODE STU5](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode) is developed. It is **not** intended to be a permanent artifact of the OGCA IG. Once adopted by mCODE, this IG will remove its local definition and reference the mCODE canonical URL instead.

This artifact carries `status = draft` and `experimental = true`. Canonical URLs will change at migration. See the [mCODE Candidates](mcode-candidates.md) page for the full migration plan.

This Code system is referenced in the definition of the following value sets:

* [TreatmentLineVS](ValueSet-treatment-line-vs.md)
